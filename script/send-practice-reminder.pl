Hello everyone,
</div>

<div>
Practice tonight will be held in the hall at Christ Church, 2138 Cedar St, Berkeley, CA 94709.
</div>

<div>
<b>ðŸš¨ COVID precautions ðŸš¨</b>
<ul>
    <li>You must have received a negative result (and not a positive result) on a
    rapid test sometime in the 24 hours leading up to practice. If you're out of
    tests, just ask! We can help each other out.
    <li>You must be fully vaccinated + boosted
    <li>Masks encouraged
</ul>
</div>

<div>
Not going to make it? Reply to this message with your best excuse, real or
fictional. This will keep practice-related conversation confined to one thread
and make everyone's inboxes easier to manage.
</div>

<div>
Cheers,<br>
Luke
